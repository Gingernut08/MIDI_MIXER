This project lets you use a physical 10-channel MIDI mixer to control the volume of individual apps on Windows. Each fader maps to a specific application, so you can change levels in real time without alt-tabbing or digging through volume sliders.
I built this because I wanted actual knobs and faders for my audio instead of fighting Windows every time Discord got loud.
